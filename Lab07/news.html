                <h2>USNA wins awards at the Data Challenge</h2>
                <p>In February 2020, led by Associate Professor Gavin Taylor of Computer Science, 43 midshipmen participated in the Big Data Challenge hosted by the University of Maryland. This year's challenge focused on data exploration for a sustainable planet. The teams were given a week to "evaluate, formulate a question about the dataset, and conduct dataset integration, analysis, and results preparation." Two of the teams from USNA won awards. The award for "Best USNA Project" went to MIDN 1/C Ryan Eilers, MIDN 1/C Jason Henry, MIDN 1/C Chesley Krug, MIDN 1/C Deon Odom for their analysis of regional traffic in the D.C. metro area. The award for "Best Team Presentation" went to MIDN 1/C Alex Wayne and 4/C Jen Sun for their analysis of the effectiveness of HUD housing programs.</p>
