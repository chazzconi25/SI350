This lab took me about four hours in total.

No suggestions for improving this lab.

Here are the two comments for the lab questions:
- What happens if your browser sets the font size to "Very large" and the CSS 
built into the page does not set any specific font size?

The page text becomes gigantic.

- What happens if your browser sets the font size to "Very large" but the CSS built
into the page sets the font size to "x-small"? Which takes effect? What if the CSS
built into the page sets the font size to "5pt"? Why do you think that is the case?

When the text size is set to "Very large" in browser but "x-small" in css the text
scales to text that is relativly x-small to the text around it. If the font is set
to "5pt" the text stayes at 5pt regardless so it looks very small. I believe this is
because x-small just means to make the text relative for users who prefer a larger
font for reading but want to maintain the visuals of the website for their poor eyes.

Finished up to 95% of the lab.
